  "description": "Long term Ethereum hobbyist, Validator and llama.  Aspiring to run all profitable but risk-minimised AVSs.  Currently on running AWS while my own hardware comes online next week.  My hardware will be co-located with fiber internet and 100% uptime guarantee.  My server will have enough storage and power to run 2 solana nodes and Llama-70B at once.",
